# About Compyle

## Our Story

Compyle was born from frustration with existing AI coding agents. Our founders, Jonathan Miranda and Mark Nazzaro, built SmartAppetite using tools like Claude Code and Cursor. They could ship a working demo in days.

Then came the hard part: maintaining the codebase they'd created but no longer fully understood.

**The Problem**: Autonomous agents move fast, but their output is often a black box. You end up spending weeks refactoring code you didn't write—code whose logic you can't trace.

**The Insight**: Good engineers clarify requirements before coding. They ask questions. They check in with stakeholders. They collaborate with peers. Why should AI agents be different?

**Our Solution**: Build an agent that actually asks. One that plans before implementing. One that validates changes in real-time. One that keeps you in the driver's seat.

That's Compyle.

## The Problem We Solve

### Today's Autonomous Agents

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Column>
  **The Promise**:

  * Move fast
  * Hands-off experience
  * Complete features quickly

  **The Reality**:

  * Black box code you can't debug
  * Architectural decisions made by the agent
  * Forced refactoring
  * Loss of code ownership
  * Technical debt from the start
</Column>

  <Column>
  **Compyle's Approach**:

  * Ask before building
  * You make architectural decisions
  * Real-time validation
  * Clear planning and research
  * Code you understand
  * Ownership throughout
</Column>
</Columns>

### Who This Matters For

Engineers and teams who care about:

- **Code quality** - They want to understand what was built
- **Maintenance** - They need to debug and modify later
- **Ownership** - They want control over architectural decisions
- **Scaling** - They need clean code that works at scale

## Y Combinator & Backing

Compyle was accepted to **Y Combinator Fall 2025 (YC F25)**, joining a batch of innovative startups.

- **Backed by**: Y Combinator, leading venture investors, and operator advisors

## Our Vision

### The Future of Software Development

We believe the future of coding is **collaborative, not autonomous**.

- Engineers stay in control
- Agents handle implementation
- Humans make architectural decisions
- Code is always understood
- Quality is maintained from the start

### Core Values

**Question-Driven**: We ask before guessing. Clarification prevents mistakes.

**Collaborative**: Engineers and AI working together, not replacing humans.

**Validating**: Real-time checks catch issues early, not after merging.

**Transparent**: All decisions documented, all reasoning visible.

## Social Proof & Community

### Product Hunt Launch

Compyle launched on Product Hunt with strong community support from engineers excited about a collaborative approach to AI coding.

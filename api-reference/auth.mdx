# API Authentication

## Generating API Keys

### Step 1: Go to Settings

Navigate to your account settings:

```
Account → Settings → API Keys
```

### Step 2: Create New Key

Click "Generate New API Key"

### Step 3: Copy Your Key

<Warning>
  Keys are displayed only once. Copy and store securely immediately.

  **Do NOT:**
  - Share with anyone
  - Commit to version control
  - Store in plain text
  - Use in client-side code
</Warning>

### Step 4: Store Securely

Store your key in an environment variable:

```bash
# .env
COMPYLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

```bash
# bash
export COMPYLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

```python
# Python
import os
api_key = os.getenv('COMPYLE_API_KEY')
```

## Using Bearer Tokens

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.compyle.ai/v1/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
const headers = {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.COMPYLE_API_KEY}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};

const response = await fetch('https://api.compyle.ai/v1/tasks', {
  headers
});
```

### Python

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get('https://api.compyle.ai/v1/tasks', headers=headers)
```

## OAuth (Coming Soon)

OAuth support is planned for Q1 2026. This will enable:

- Multi-user applications
- Third-party integrations
- User impersonation workflows
- Scope-based permissions

**Timeline**: Q1 2026

## API Key Rotation

Keep your keys secure by rotating regularly:

### Rotate a Key

1. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Click on the key you want to rotate
3. Click "Regenerate"
4. Update applications with new key
5. Delete old key after verification

### Compromised Key?

If your key is compromised:

1. **Immediately** go to API Keys
2. Click "Delete" on the compromised key
3. Generate a new key
4. Update all applications
5. Monitor API activity for abuse

## Security Best Practices

<Tip title="Never Hardcode Keys">
  Always use environment variables or secure secrets management
</Tip>

<Tip title="Limit Scope">
  Use restricted keys for specific applications when available
</Tip>

<Tip title="Rotate Regularly">
  Rotate keys every 90 days as a security best practice
</Tip>

<Tip title="Monitor Activity">
  Check API activity regularly for suspicious requests
</Tip>

<Tip title="Use HTTPS">
  Always make API requests over HTTPS, never HTTP
</Tip>

<Tip title="Separate Keys">
  Use different keys for different applications/environments
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized">
    - Verify API key is correct
    - Check key hasn't expired or been deleted
    - Ensure Authorization header is present
    - Verify header format: `Authorization: Bearer KEY`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="403 Forbidden">
    - Check if key has permission for this endpoint
    - Verify associated plan tier
    - Contact support if permission issue persists
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Lost my API key">
    - You cannot recover a deleted key
    - Generate a new key
    - Update applications with new key
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rate limited with valid key">
    - Check rate limits for your plan
    - Implement exponential backoff
    - Consider upgrading plan if needed
  </Accordion>

</Tip>

**Why This Matters:**
The three-phase workflow ensures code quality through collaboration, not blind automation. You stay in control while the AI handles implementation details.

### Code Review & Validation
**August 5, 2024** • New Feature

<Accordion title="🛡️ Real-Time Validation System">
  **What It Does:**

  Validates every code change during implementation, not after. Catches issues before they reach your PR.

  **Validation Checks:**
  - **Pattern Matching:** Code matches custom rules
  - **Plan Alignment:** Implementation follows planning decisions
  - **Code Quality:** Syntax correctness, type safety
  - **Breaking Changes:** Existing functionality preserved

  **When Validation Fails:**

  Agent stops and asks:
  - Approve exception (document why)
  - Modify approach (use different pattern)
  - Adjust rule (if rule needs updating)

  **Benefits:**
  - Catch issues during build, not after
  - Consistent code quality across all tasks
  - Fewer review cycles and rework
  - Higher confidence in generated code

  **Example Scenario:**
  ```
  ❌ VALIDATION FAILED

  Rule: "No console.log in production"
  File: src/api/users.ts:127
  Issue: console.log("User created") violates rule

  Options:
  1. Skip this line (approve exception)
  2. Use logger service instead
  3. Adjust rule for this context
  ```

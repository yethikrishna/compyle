### How Documentation AI Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Instant Answers">
    **Ask questions in natural language:**
    - "How do I set up custom rules for TypeScript?"
    - "Walk me through creating my first task"
    - "What's the difference between research and planning phase?"

    **AI responds with:**
    - Direct answers from documentation
    - Links to relevant pages
    - Code examples when applicable
    - Follow-up suggestions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Contextual Help">
    **AI knows where you are:**
    - Reading about custom rules? Get rule examples
    - On API page? See authentication snippets
    - Viewing workflow docs? Get phase-specific tips

    **Adaptive responses based on:**
    - Current documentation page
    - Your user role (new user, power user, developer)
    - Project type (if detected from context)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step-by-Step Guidance">
    **Interactive walkthroughs:**
    - Request: "Walk me through setting up GitHub integration"
    - AI provides numbered steps with explanations
    - Follow-up questions answered in context
    - Can repeat or clarify any step

    **Examples:**
    - Setting up your first project
    - Configuring custom rules
    - Understanding agent workflow
    - Debugging common issues
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Troubleshooting Assistant">
    **Describe your issue:**
    - "Agent keeps asking the same questions"
    - "Custom rules not being applied"
    - "How to optimize credit usage?"

    **AI helps by:**
    - Identifying likely causes
    - Suggesting solutions from docs
    - Linking to relevant troubleshooting guides
    - Escalating to human support if needed
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  **Privacy Note:** Documentation AI assistant operates on public documentation content only. It does not access your code, projects, or private data.
</Info>

### Multi-Language Support

Documentation is available in multiple languages with intelligent location detection:

**Default Language: English**
- All documentation is authored in English
- English is the default for all users worldwide
- Never auto-switches based on location

**Available Languages:**
- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English (Default) - `/docs/en/`
- ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Malayalam - `/docs/ml/`
- ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Hindi - `/docs/hi/`
- More languages coming soon

**How Language Selection Works:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Automatic Detection (Optional Suggestion Only)">
    System detects your location via IP or browser locale

    Shows subtle suggestion: *"Docs are also available in Malayalam. Would you like to switch?"*

    **[Yes]** or **[No, keep English]**

    Never forces navigation without explicit user action
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manual Language Selection">
    Use language selector in documentation header

    Choose your preferred language

    Preference saved for future visits
  </Step>
  <Step title="URL-Based Routing">
    Each language has its own URL prefix:
    - English: `https://compyle.mintlify.app/docs/en/`
    - Malayalam: `https://compyle.mintlify.app/docs/ml/`
    - Hindi: `https://compyle.mintlify.app/docs/hi/`

    Bookmarks and links maintain language context
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fallback to English">
    If translated content unavailable, automatically shows English version

    Maintains navigation structure

    Shows notice: *"This page is available in English only"*
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Language Selection Principles:**
- âœ… **User Choice:** Always manual selection, never forced
- âœ… **Suggestion:** Location-based suggestion shown once
- âœ… **Persistence:** Language preference saved
- âœ… **Fallback:** English content always available
- âœ… **URL Routing:** Clean `/docs/{lang}/` structure

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Product & Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What makes Compyle different from Claude Code or Cursor?">
    Unlike autonomous agents that guess and move forward, Compyle asks clarifying questions before planning and implementing. You stay in the driver's seat throughout the entire process. The agent validates every change in real-time against your custom rules and planning decisions.

    **Compyle**: Questions → Planning → Implementation (with validation)
    **Autonomous agents**: Execute autonomously, hope it's right
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is Compyle free?">
    Yes, Compyle is completely free during beta. No credit card required.

    After beta, we'll offer paid plans. Details coming soon.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to be a technical expert to use Compyle?">
    You should be comfortable with code and your project's architecture. Compyle is designed for engineers who understand their codebase and can make architectural decisions.

    If you can code and maintain your project, you can use Compyle effectively.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which programming languages and frameworks does Compyle support?">
    Compyle works with any programming language and framework. We've tested it extensively with:

    - **JavaScript/TypeScript** - React, Next.js, Express
    - **Python** - Django, FastAPI, Flask
    - **Go** - Standard library, web frameworks
    - **Rust** - Cargo, Actix, Rocket
    - **Java** - Spring, JUnit

    If it's a GitHub repo with code, Compyle can help.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Compyle with private repositories?">
    Yes. When you connect Compyle, you authorize it to access your private repositories. Compyle respects GitHub's permission settings.

    Only repositories you explicitly connect are accessed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does a typical task take?">
    Typical timeline:
    - Research phase: 1-5 minutes
    - Planning phase: 5-30 minutes (depends on complexity and your response time)
    - Implementation phase: 5 minutes to several hours (depends on complexity)
    - Total: Usually 30 minutes to 2 hours for a typical feature

    Larger features might take longer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I cancel a task mid-way?">
    Yes. You can stop a task at any point. Your work and answers are saved, and you can resume later if you want.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

</AccordionGroup>

## Code Review & Quality

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How good is the generated code?">
    Quality depends on several factors:

    1. **Your task description** - Clear descriptions → better code
    2. **Custom rules** - Well-defined rules → more consistent code
    3. **Codebase patterns** - Clear existing patterns → agent follows them
    4. **Your feedback** - Active review and feedback → continuous improvement

    The agent is only as good as the guidance you provide.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to review all generated code?">
    Yes. All agent-generated code should be reviewed before merging, just like code from a new team member.

    The difference: With Compyle, you review during implementation, not after. This prevents issues from happening in the first place.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I don't like the generated code?">
    You have options:

    1. **Modify it** - Edit the PR before merging
    2. **Reject it** - Abort task and try again with better guidance
    3. **Provide feedback** - Explain what you'd prefer
    4. **Add rules** - Define patterns for future tasks

    Use these situations to improve your process.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I ensure code quality?">
    Best practices:

    1. Write clear task descriptions
    2. Define comprehensive custom rules
    3. Review code during implementation (not after)
    4. Test locally before merging
    5. Document exceptions when you approve them
    6. Continuously refine your rules

    See [Code Review Guide](/features/code-review) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Compyle write tests?">
    Yes, if you ask for them in the task description.

    Example: "Add unit tests for all new functions with 80%+ coverage"

    Include testing requirements in your task description.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

    - Mention edge cases upfront
    - Provide examples
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Generated code doesn't match my style">
    Add custom rules to enforce your style:

    1. Identify the pattern you want
    2. Add a rule to enforce it
    3. Run new task to test
    4. Refine rule as needed

    See [Custom Rules](/features/custom-rules).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm out of credits this month">
    Options:

    1. Wait for next month's allocation
    2. Upgrade to a higher plan
    3. Contact support for additional credits

    See [Billing](/getting-started/billing).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The agent seems to misunderstand my codebase">
    This happens during research phase. Options:

    1. **Provide feedback** - Tell the agent what it misunderstood
    2. **Adjust task description** - Include specific file references
    3. **Skip research** - For simple, well-defined tasks

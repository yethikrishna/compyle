# Frequently Asked Questions

## Product & Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What makes Compyle different from Claude Code or Cursor?">
    Unlike autonomous agents that guess and move forward, Compyle asks clarifying questions before planning and implementing. You stay in the driver's seat throughout the entire process. The agent validates every change in real-time against your custom rules and planning decisions.

    **Compyle**: Questions → Planning → Implementation (with validation)
    **Autonomous agents**: Execute autonomously, hope it's right
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is Compyle free?">
    Yes, Compyle is completely free during beta. No credit card required.

    After beta, we'll offer paid plans. Details coming soon.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to be a technical expert to use Compyle?">
    You should be comfortable with code and your project's architecture. Compyle is designed for engineers who understand their codebase and can make architectural decisions.

    If you can code and maintain your project, you can use Compyle effectively.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Code Review & Quality

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How good is the generated code?">
    Quality depends on several factors:

    1. **Your task description** - Clear descriptions → better code
    2. **Custom rules** - Well-defined rules → more consistent code
    3. **Codebase patterns** - Clear existing patterns → agent follows them
    4. **Your feedback** - Active review and feedback → continuous improvement

    The agent is only as good as the guidance you provide.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to review all generated code?">
    Yes. All agent-generated code should be reviewed before merging, just like code from a new team member.

    The difference: With Compyle, you review during implementation, not after. This prevents issues from happening in the first place.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I don't like the generated code?">
    You have options:

    1. **Modify it** - Edit the PR before merging
    2. **Reject it** - Abort task and try again with better guidance
    3. **Provide feedback** - Explain what you'd prefer
    4. **Add rules** - Define patterns for future tasks

    Use these situations to improve your process.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I ensure code quality?">
    Best practices:

    1. Write clear task descriptions
    2. Define comprehensive custom rules
    3. Review code during implementation (not after)
    4. Test locally before merging
    5. Document exceptions when you approve them
    6. Continuously refine your rules

    See [Code Review Guide](/features/code-review) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Compyle write tests?">
    Yes, if you ask for them in the task description.

    Example: "Add unit tests for all new functions with 80%+ coverage"

    Include testing requirements in your task description.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The agent asked too many questions">
    This usually means your task description was too vague.

    **Next time**:
    - Be more specific about requirements
    - Include file names and existing patterns
    - Mention edge cases upfront
    - Provide examples
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Generated code doesn't match my style">
    Add custom rules to enforce your style:

    1. Identify the pattern you want
    2. Add a rule to enforce it
    3. Run new task to test
    4. Refine rule as needed

    See [Custom Rules](/features/custom-rules).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm out of credits this month">
    Options:

    1. Wait for next month's allocation
    2. Upgrade to a higher plan
    3. Contact support for additional credits

    See [Billing](/getting-started/billing).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The agent seems to misunderstand my codebase">
    This happens during research phase. Options:

    1. **Provide feedback** - Tell the agent what it misunderstood
    2. **Adjust task description** - Include specific file references
    3. **Skip research** - For simple, well-defined tasks
    4. **Add rules** - Define your codebase patterns

    Research should be reviewed carefully. Catch misunderstandings early.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Agent Issues (Critical Priority)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent died with no response - Recovery procedure">
    **Problem**: The agent stops responding mid-task, showing no activity or progress updates.

    **Symptoms**:
    - Agent appears frozen or unresponsive
    - No new commits or PR updates
    - Task status shows "In Progress" but nothing happens
    - No error messages displayed

    **Solution - Agent Death Recovery** (from Jake Martin):
    1. Find the pull request associated with the task
    2. Note the commit hash from the last successful commit
    3. Copy the "Planning" section from the task details
    4. Open a new tab and go to [https://app.compyle.ai](https://app.compyle.ai)
    5. Create a new project with the same requirements
    6. Paste the planning into the new task
    7. This allows you to continue where you left off

    **Prevention**:
    - Save planning artifacts regularly
    - Monitor task progress actively
    - Keep notes on task requirements for quick restart
    - Set up browser bookmarks for quick access to app

    **Technical Notes**: Agent death can be caused by upstream service interruptions, memory issues, or connection timeouts. The recovery procedure preserves your progress and planning decisions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent thinks it's a planning agent only, not an implementation agent">
    **Problem**: Agent provides planning and suggestions but doesn't actually implement code changes.

    **Symptoms**:
    - Agent responds with plans and suggestions
    - No code commits or file changes
    - Task remains in planning phase indefinitely
    - Agent asks "Would you like me to implement this?"

    **Solution**:
    1. In your task description, explicitly state: "Implement the following changes..."
    2. Use action verbs: "Create", "Build", "Modify", "Add", not "Plan" or "Suggest"
    3. If already stuck, send a message: "Please implement these changes now"
    4. Restart the task with clearer implementation instructions if needed

    **Prevention**:
    - Always use implementation-focused language in task descriptions
    - Start tasks with "Implement...", "Create...", "Build..."
    - Avoid phrases like "How would I..." or "What do you think about..."
    - Be explicit that you want code changes, not just suggestions

    **Technical Notes**: The agent's behavior is influenced by the phrasing of your initial request. Implementation-focused language triggers the correct workflow mode.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent stuck in loading loop">
    **Problem**: Agent shows continuous loading spinner without progress or completion.

    **Symptoms**:
    - Infinite loading indicator
    - Browser tab remains active but shows no updates
    - No error messages or timeouts
    - Task status doesn't change

    **Solution**:
    1. Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
    2. Check the task in a different browser or incognito window
    3. Verify your internet connection is stable
    4. Check GitHub to see if commits were actually made
    5. If commits exist, the task may have completed despite UI issues
    6. Contact support if loading persists beyond 5 minutes

    **Prevention**:
    - Maintain stable internet connection during tasks
    - Avoid switching tabs during critical task phases
    - Keep browser and extensions updated
    - Clear browser cache regularly

    **Technical Notes**: Loading loops are often UI state issues. The backend may have completed work even if the frontend doesn't reflect it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent won't stop/wrap up finished task">
    **Problem**: Agent continues running or making changes after task appears complete.

    **Symptoms**:
    - Task shows complete but agent still active
    - Additional unexpected commits after completion
    - Cannot start new tasks due to "agent busy" status
    - PR keeps getting updated with minor changes

    **Solution**:
    1. Send explicit message: "Task is complete. Please stop and finalize."
    2. Navigate to task dashboard and click "Complete Task" button
    3. If button unavailable, refresh page and try again
    4. Check PR to ensure all desired changes are present
    5. Close the task manually from task list if agent doesn't respond
    6. Contact support if unable to stop the agent

    **Prevention**:
    - Set clear completion criteria in task description
    - Review PR before final approval
    - Use "Mark as Complete" promptly when satisfied
    - Be explicit about scope boundaries in planning phase

    **Technical Notes**: Sometimes the agent continues optimizing or refining beyond the core requirements. Clear acceptance criteria help prevent this.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent stopped - max_tokens error">
    **Problem**: Agent halts with "max_tokens" or "context length exceeded" error.

    **Symptoms**:
    - Error message mentioning tokens or context limit
    - Task stops abruptly mid-implementation
    - Partial implementation in PR
    - Cannot resume from stopping point

    **Solution**:
    1. Review what was completed before the error
    2. Break down remaining work into smaller, focused tasks
    3. Create new task for remaining work, referencing completed changes
    4. Be more specific about scope to reduce context needs
    5. If recurring, contact support about token allocation

    **Prevention - Token Management Strategies**:
    - Break large features into smaller, focused tasks
    - Limit file scope in task descriptions
    - Use specific file paths rather than broad searches
    - Skip research phase for well-defined tasks
    - Reference specific line numbers when possible
    - Avoid asking agent to analyze entire large codebases

    **Technical Notes**: Token limits are per-session. Complex tasks with large context (many files, long discussions) exhaust the limit faster. Strategic task scoping is key.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent not going back to research">
    **Problem**: Agent proceeds without sufficient research or understanding of codebase.

    **Symptoms**:
    - Agent makes changes without understanding existing patterns
    - Code doesn't match project style or architecture
    - Missing important context from other files
    - Implements duplicate functionality that already exists

    **Solution**:
    1. Explicitly request: "Please research [specific area] before implementing"
    2. Point agent to specific files: "Review [filename] for patterns"
    3. Ask clarifying questions to verify understanding
    4. Cancel and restart with "Enable Research Phase" if needed
    5. Provide examples from codebase in task description

    **Prevention**:
    - Don't skip research phase for complex or unfamiliar areas
    - Reference key files in task description
    - Include "Research existing [pattern/component] first" in requirements
    - Set up proper custom rules to guide agent
    - Use pattern library for consistent implementations

    **Technical Notes**: Research phase quality directly impacts implementation quality. For new areas of codebase or complex features, research is essential.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model not showing the planning">
    **Problem**: Planning phase completes but no planning document or questions are visible.

    **Symptoms**:
    - Task moves from Research to Implementation
    - No planning questions were asked
    - Cannot review what agent is about to do
    - Planning tab is empty or missing

    **Solution**:
    1. Check the "Planning" tab in task details page
    2. Look for notifications that may contain planning questions
    3. Check your notification settings (questions may be filtered)
    4. Review PR description - planning may be documented there
    5. If no planning visible anywhere, stop the task immediately
    6. Contact support with task ID - this shouldn't happen

    **Prevention**:
    - Enable all notification types in settings
    - Check multiple locations (tabs, notifications, PR)
    - Use browser that supports all Compyle features
    - Don't skip planning phase for complex tasks

    **Technical Notes**: Planning visibility is critical for validation workflow. This is a serious issue if planning is truly missing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model not listening to commands">
    **Problem**: Agent ignores instructions or feedback provided during task execution.

    **Symptoms**:
    - Agent proceeds despite explicit instructions to stop or change approach
    - Feedback not reflected in subsequent commits
    - Agent repeats same mistakes after correction
    - Commands like "stop", "pause", "change approach" have no effect

    **Solution**:
    1. Use clear, direct imperative language: "Stop this approach"
    2. Be very specific: "Do NOT modify file X"
    3. If agent continues, use the Stop/Cancel button in UI
    4. Create new task with more explicit constraints
    5. Add custom rules to prevent unwanted behaviors
    6. Include constraints in initial task description, not just feedback

    **Prevention**:
    - Front-load constraints and requirements in task description
    - Use custom rules for hard constraints
    - Be explicit about what NOT to do
    - Monitor first few commits closely
    - Catch issues early before agent goes too far
    - Use clear, unambiguous language

    **Technical Notes**: Mid-task feedback is less effective than upfront requirements. The agent's initial planning heavily influences subsequent behavior.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## GitHub Integration Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cannot push changes to GitHub - Permission denied">
    **Problem**: Agent completes work but fails to push commits to GitHub repository.

    **Symptoms**:
    - Error: "Permission denied" or "403 Forbidden"
    - Commits visible in task but not on GitHub
    - PR creation fails
    - Authentication errors in task logs

    **Solution**:
    1. Check GitHub app installation at [GitHub Apps settings](https://github.com/settings/installations)
    2. Verify Compyle has access to the specific repository
    3. Ensure repository permissions include "Read and write" for Contents and Pull requests
    4. Disconnect and reconnect GitHub in Compyle Settings → Integrations
    5. Try removing and re-installing the Compyle GitHub App
    6. Verify you have write access to the repository yourself

    **Prevention - GitHub Integration Best Practices**:
    - Verify repository permissions when connecting new repos
    - Regularly check token status hasn't expired
    - Ensure proper repository permissions in GitHub settings
    - Keep GitHub app updated with latest permission requirements
    - Use webhooks for real-time synchronization
    - Regularly refresh authentication

    **Technical Notes**: GitHub tokens can expire or have insufficient scopes. The Compyle GitHub App needs specific permissions to create branches and PRs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Branch creation issues - Branch doesn't appear on GitHub">
    **Problem**: Compyle creates a branch locally but it doesn't appear on GitHub.

    **Symptoms**:
    - Task shows branch created
    - Branch not visible on GitHub repository
    - Cannot find branch in branch dropdown
    - PR creation fails due to missing branch

    **Solution**:
    1. Verify branch name in task details
    2. Check GitHub repository's branch list (including "All branches")
    3. Try fetching all branches: `git fetch --all` locally
    4. Check if branch is protected or has naming restrictions
    5. Verify Compyle has push permissions (see previous section)
    6. Look for branch on GitHub under PR tab (may be in open PRs)

    **Prevention**:
    - Ensure stable internet connection during task execution
    - Verify GitHub app permissions include branch creation
    - Avoid special characters in task names (affects branch names)
    - Check repository settings don't restrict branch creation

    **Technical Notes**: Branch synchronization requires successful push. Network issues or permission problems during push will cause this.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Problems with GitHub connection">
    **Problem**: Compyle repeatedly loses connection to GitHub or shows disconnected status.

    **Symptoms**:
    - Frequent "GitHub disconnected" messages
    - Must reconnect GitHub multiple times
    - Tasks fail mid-execution with connection errors
    - Repositories disappear from project list

    **Solution**:
    1. Revoke and reinstall the Compyle GitHub App
    2. Check GitHub's service status at [GitHub Status](https://www.githubstatus.com)
    3. Clear browser cache and cookies
    4. Try different browser to rule out browser-specific issues
    5. Verify your GitHub account is in good standing
    6. Check for VPN or network restrictions blocking GitHub API
    7. Contact support if issue persists after trying above steps

    **Prevention**:
    - Maintain stable internet connection
    - Don't revoke Compyle's GitHub access manually
    - Keep GitHub credentials current
    - Monitor GitHub API status before large tasks
    - Report persistent connection issues to support

    **Technical Notes**: GitHub connection requires valid OAuth tokens and proper API access. Network restrictions or GitHub service issues can cause interruptions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot create PR - Validation failed">
    **Problem**: PR creation fails with validation errors after task completes.

    **Symptoms**:
    - Error: "Validation failed" or "Failed to create pull request"
    - Commits exist but no PR created
    - Task shows complete but no PR link
    - GitHub API error messages

    **Solution**:
    1. Check if PR already exists for this branch
    2. Verify base branch still exists and is up to date
    3. Ensure branch has new commits (not already merged)
    4. Check repository settings for PR restrictions
    5. Manually create PR from the branch on GitHub
    6. Verify your GitHub account can create PRs on this repository

    **Prevention**:
    - Ensure base branch is current before starting tasks
    - Don't manually merge branches Compyle is working on
    - Check repository branch protection rules
    - Verify collaborator permissions if repository is not yours

    **Technical Notes**: PR creation can fail due to branch state, permissions, or GitHub repository settings. Manual PR creation is a reliable fallback.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Constantly getting redirected to install the bot on GitHub">
    **Problem**: Every action redirects to GitHub App installation page.

    **Symptoms**:
    - Endless redirect loop to GitHub
    - "Install Compyle" page shown repeatedly
    - Cannot access Compyle dashboard
    - Authentication never completes

    **Solution**:
    1. Complete the GitHub App installation if not done
    2. Accept all requested permissions during installation
    3. Clear browser cookies and cache completely
    4. Try incognito/private browsing window
    5. Ensure you're logged into the correct GitHub account
    6. Check if browser extensions are interfering
    7. Try different browser to isolate browser-specific issues
    8. Contact support if installation appears complete but redirects continue

    **Prevention**:
    - Complete GitHub App installation fully without interruption
    - Grant all requested permissions during setup
    - Use supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
    - Disable aggressive cookie/tracker blocking for app.compyle.ai

    **Technical Notes**: This is typically a session state or cookie issue. The authentication flow requires cookies to be enabled and preserved.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="COMPYLE keeps losing authentication token">
    **Problem**: Frequent re-authentication required; GitHub token expires unexpectedly.

    **Symptoms**:
    - "Please reconnect GitHub" messages frequently
    - Authentication required multiple times per day
    - Tasks interrupted with authentication errors
    - Token shown as expired in settings

    **Solution**:
    1. Fully disconnect GitHub in Settings
    2. Revoke Compyle access in [GitHub Settings → Applications](https://github.com/settings/applications)
    3. Reinstall Compyle GitHub App completely
    4. Reconnect GitHub in Compyle with fresh authentication
    5. Verify you're not using private/incognito mode regularly
    6. Check browser settings allow persistent cookies for app.compyle.ai
    7. Contact support if issue persists after fresh reinstall

    **Prevention - Authentication Token Management**:
    - Use regular browser windows (not incognito) for Compyle
    - Allow cookies for app.compyle.ai domain
    - Don't manually revoke Compyle's GitHub access
    - Keep browser logged into GitHub
    - Avoid clearing cookies while tasks are running
    - Use recommended browsers with proper cookie support

    **Technical Notes**: OAuth tokens have expiration times. Browser cookie settings or privacy tools can interfere with token storage. Regular mode browsing is recommended.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to update PR after accidental creation">
    **Problem**: Need to modify or update a PR that was created prematurely or with wrong settings.

    **Symptoms**:
    - PR created but needs changes
    - Wrong base branch selected
    - Incomplete implementation in PR
    - Want to add more changes before review

    **Solution**:
    1. Don't close the PR - keep it open
    2. In Compyle, create a new task targeting the same branch
    3. Or make changes locally and push to the PR's branch
    4. PR will automatically update with new commits
    5. Update PR title and description on GitHub as needed
    6. To change base branch: close PR, change base, reopen
    7. For major errors, close PR and start over with new task

    **Prevention**:
    - Review task completion thoroughly before finalizing
    - Verify base branch in task setup
    - Use clear task descriptions to avoid incomplete work
    - Check PR preview before finalizing if available

    **Technical Notes**: PRs are linked to branches. Any new commits to the branch will update the PR. Base branch changes require PR recreation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## API and Resource Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Error 400 - Usage Limit Reached">
    **Problem**: Task fails with "Usage Limit Reached" or similar 400 error.

    **Symptoms**:
    - Error 400 in task logs
    - Message about rate limits or quotas
    - Task stops abruptly
    - Cannot start new tasks

    **Solution**:
    1. Check your credit balance in Settings → Billing
    2. Wait if you've hit rate limits (usually resets within an hour)
    3. If using custom API key, check Anthropic dashboard for limits
    4. Reduce task scope to use fewer credits
    5. Upgrade plan if regularly hitting limits
    6. Contact support if limits seem incorrect

    **Prevention - Usage Limit Management**:
    - Monitor credit usage regularly
    - Check rate limits before starting large tasks
    - Implement exponential backoff for retries (automatic in Compyle)
    - Use resource-efficient approaches:
      - Skip research for simple tasks
      - Provide specific file paths
      - Break large tasks into smaller ones
    - Set up usage alerts if available
    - Plan high-credit tasks during off-peak times

    **Technical Notes**: API rate limits protect service stability. Both Compyle account limits and upstream API (Anthropic) limits can apply.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invalid API key errors">
    **Problem**: Errors indicating API key is invalid, missing, or malformed.

    **Symptoms**:
    - "Invalid API key" error message
    - Authentication failures with AI provider
    - Tasks fail immediately at start
    - 401 Unauthorized errors

# Advanced Features

Advanced features for power users who want to optimize Compyle for their specific needs.

## Custom LLM Provider

Use your own Anthropic API key instead of Compyle's default:

### Why Use Custom Provider?

- **Cost control** - Track spending directly
- **Usage limits** - Set your own rate limits
- **Data privacy** - Your API, your data
- **Model choice** - Use specific model versions

### Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your API Key">
    Visit [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
    Generate an API key with Compyle scope
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Account → Integrations → "Custom LLM Provider"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste Your Key">
    Add your Anthropic API key
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify">
    Compyle tests the key before saving
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use in Tasks">
    New tasks will use your API key
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Security:**
  - Never share your API key
  - Store securely in environment variables
  - Rotate regularly
  - Regenerate if compromised
</Warning>

### Cost Optimization

<Tip title="Monitor API Usage">
  Track usage in Anthropic console:
  - Daily spend
  - Token consumption
  - Rate limit status
  - Cost per task
</Tip>

<Tip title="Optimize Task Scope">
  Smaller tasks use fewer tokens:
  - 1 hour task = fewer tokens
  - 4 hour task = many more tokens
  - Break large tasks into smaller ones
</Tip>

## AI Guidance & Customization

Teach Compyle's AI to code your way:

### Custom Rules for AI Behavior

Guide the AI agent with project-specific patterns:

```yaml
# Tell AI to always use specific patterns
rules:
  - name: "API Response Format"
    pattern: "Always return { success, data, error }"
    scope: "**/*Controller.ts"

  - name: "React Component Structure"
    pattern: "Use functional components with TypeScript"
    forbidden: "Class components"

  - name: "Error Handling"
    pattern: "Use custom ApiError class"
    enforcement: "strict"
```

**See [Custom Rules](/features/custom-rules) for complete guide.**

### AI Context Management

Control what the AI knows about your project:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Context Window Optimization">
    **How Compyle Uses 200K Tokens:**
    - **Research Phase:** Reads relevant files (10-30% of window)
    - **Planning Phase:** Maintains research + conversation (40-60%)
    - **Implementation:** Full context including code changes (70-90%)

    **Best Practices:**
    - Let AI read full files vs. snippets
    - Include relevant documentation in repo
    - Keep `.gitignore` clean for focused analysis
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="File Priority Signals">
    **AI automatically prioritizes:**
    - Recently modified files
    - Files mentioned in task description
    - Dependencies of target files
    - Configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json)
    - README and documentation files

    **You can guide priority:**
    - Mention specific files in task description
    - Reference line numbers for precision
    - Link to related PRs or issues
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Knowledge Cutoff & Current Info">
    **Claude's training data cutoff:** January 2025

    **What AI knows:**
    - Programming languages and frameworks up to Jan 2025
    - Common libraries and their APIs
    - Software engineering best practices
    - Security patterns and vulnerabilities

    **What AI doesn't know:**
    - Your proprietary codebase (until it reads it)
    - Internal company tools or APIs
    - Private packages or frameworks
    - Changes to libraries after Jan 2025

    **Solution:** Provide context in task description or custom rules
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### AI Learning & Adaptation

**How Compyle's AI learns from your project:**

1. **Pattern Recognition:** Analyzes existing code to identify conventions
2. **Style Matching:** Replicates your formatting, naming, structure
3. **Custom Rules:** Remembers project-specific requirements
4. **Feedback Loop:** Learns from your questions and corrections

<Info>
**Important:** The AI doesn't permanently "learn" or train on your code. Each task starts fresh, using research phase to understand patterns. Custom rules persist across tasks, providing consistent guidance.
</Info>

## AI-Powered Features

### Smart Code Completion

AI understands partial implementations and completes logically:

**Example:**
```typescript
// You write:
function calculateUserScore(user: User) {
  // TODO: Calculate score based on activity, posts, comments

// AI completes:
function calculateUserScore(user: User): number {
  const activityScore = user.loginDays * 2;
  const postScore = user.posts.length * 5;
  const commentScore = user.comments.length * 1;

  return activityScore + postScore + commentScore;
}
```

### Intelligent Refactoring

AI suggests and implements improvements:

    Optimizes algorithms and reduces complexity
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modularity" icon="cubes">
    Breaks large functions into smaller, testable units
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Context-Aware Suggestions

AI considers your entire codebase when making suggestions:

**Example Scenario:**
- **Task:** "Add user authentication"
- **AI notices:** You already have auth for admin panel
- **AI suggests:** Reuse existing AuthService with role-based permissions
- **Result:** Consistent authentication across entire app

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## AI Limitations & Best Practices

### What AI Cannot Do

<Warning>
**Be aware of these limitations:**

1. **No Internet Access:** AI cannot fetch latest docs or package info during task
2. **Knowledge Cutoff:** May not know about very recent framework changes
3. **No File System Access:** Cannot test or run code (validates logically instead)
4. **No External APIs:** Cannot call your staging/production environments
5. **No Magic:** Cannot guess requirements - needs clear task descriptions
</Warning>

### Best Practices for Working with AI

### Optimizing AI Performance

**Get better results faster:**

1. **Clear Task Descriptions:**
   - ✅ "Add email validation to signup form using regex pattern"
   - ❌ "Fix signup"

2. **Relevant Context:**
   - Mention related files
   - Reference similar implementations
   - Explain business requirements

3. **Effective Feedback:**
   - Point to specific issues
   - Provide examples of desired output
   - Explain "why" not just "what"

4. **Strategic Custom Rules:**
   - Document patterns you want consistently
   - Add rules for common mistakes
   - Include architectural decisions

<Tip title="Pro Tip: Use Research Artifacts">
  The research.md file is gold. Review it to see what AI understood about your codebase. Correct any misunderstandings before planning phase.
</Tip>

## Agent Spend Optimization

Optimize token consumption and credits:

### Research Phase Tuning

- **Full Research**: Comprehensive analysis (uses more credits)
- **Quick Research**: Focused analysis (uses fewer credits)
- **Skip Research**: For simple tasks (saves 20-30% credits)

**When to skip:**
- Simple bug fixes
- Well-defined small tasks
- Following existing patterns

**When to keep:**
- New features
- Architectural changes
- First tasks in new codebase

### Planning Phase Optimization

- **Ask all questions**: Comprehensive planning
- **Ask key questions**: Focus on critical decisions
- **Skip planning**: For very simple tasks (not recommended)

**Results:**
- More planning questions = better implementation
- Fewer questions = faster execution, potential ambiguity

### Implementation Batching

Create multiple related tasks to reuse context:

```
Task 1: Create user model (45 min)
Task 2: Add API endpoints (1 hour)
Task 3: Build UI components (1.5 hours)

Total: Faster than one large task
Reason: Agent learns context in Task 1,
        applies efficiently in Tasks 2 & 3
```

## Batch Task Management

Run multiple tasks efficiently:

### Task Chaining

Create dependent tasks in sequence:

1. **First task** - Core functionality
2. **Second task** - Builds on first
3. **Third task** - Final polish

Benefits:
- Agent maintains architectural understanding
- Consistent patterns across tasks
- Better resource utilization

### Parallel Tasks

For independent features (not recommended unless experienced):

- Design review required before running in parallel
- Risk of conflicting changes
- Requires careful coordination
- Use chaining instead when possible

## Advanced Project Settings

### Repository Configuration

- **Default branch** - Usually `main`
- **Branch naming** - Pattern for feature branches
- **Protected branches** - Cannot merge without review
- **Auto-delete branches** - Clean up after merge

### Integration Settings

## Best Practices

<Tip title="Enable Critical Notifications">
  Never disable:
  - Planning questions (you must answer)
  - Completion notifications (you need to review)
  - Error alerts (action needed)
</Tip>

<Tip title="Batch Digest Mode">
  For teams: Enable daily digest to reduce notification noise while staying informed
</Tip>

<Tip title="Quick Response">
  When awaiting response notifications arrive, answer promptly to keep task momentum
</Tip>

<Tip title="Archive Old Notifications">
  Keep notification center clean by archiving completed tasks
</Tip>

## Notification Channels

### In-App Dashboard

Most immediate and visible. Use for:
- Real-time monitoring
- Watching implementation
- Catching issues early

### Email

Good for:
- Tracking across days
- Review outside of dashboard
- Archivable record

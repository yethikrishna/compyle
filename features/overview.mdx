# Platform Overview

## Compyle's Philosophy: Planning Before Building

Compyle is fundamentally different from autonomous coding agents. We believe in:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Collaborative" icon="handshake">
    Not autonomous. We ask, you decide.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Planned" icon="clipboard">
    Research and plan before writing code.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Validated" icon="check-circle">
    Real-time checks prevent issues.
  </Card>

## Why This Approach?

### The Problem with Autonomous Agents

<Columns>
  <Column>
    **Autonomous agents:**
    - Make decisions without asking
    - Output code you don't understand
    - Force refactoring later
    - Make you lose control
    - Press forward despite uncertainty
  </Column>
  <Column>
    **Compyle is different:**
    - Asks clarifying questions first
    - Plan before implementation
    - Real-time validation checks
    - You stay in control
    - Stops and asks, never guesses
  </Column>
</Columns>

## Core Principles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Question-Driven">
    Agents should ask before guessing. Clarification prevents rework. Your answers become the specification.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Collaborative">
    You make architectural decisions. Agent handles implementation. Partnership, not replacement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Validating">
    Every change checked against the plan. Custom rules enforced in real-time. Issues surfaced immediately.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Transparent">
    All decisions documented. Research and planning artifacts visible. Full visibility into reasoning.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Workflows

### 0→1 Feature Development

**Best for**: Building new features from scratch

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Task">
    Define the feature you want to build
  </Step>
  <Step title="Research Phase">
    Agent learns your codebase and patterns
  </Step>
  <Step title="Planning Phase">
    Agent asks clarifying questions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implementation">
    Agent builds with validation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Result">
    Ship production code with confidence
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Bug Fixing

**Best for**: Fixing specific issues and regressions

The workflow is similar, but focused and targeted. Compyle understands the bug context and implements a precise fix while following your patterns.

### Refactoring

**Best for**: Improving existing code and architecture

Define your refactoring goal → Agent learns current structure → Plans changes → Implements → Result: Cleaner code that fits your architecture

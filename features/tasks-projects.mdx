# Tasks & Projects

## Understanding Projects

Projects are containers for your coding tasks, organized around repositories or logical features.

**One project per codebase** is the typical pattern:
- Organize all related tasks together
- Configure project-wide rules and settings
- Maintain consistent patterns across tasks
- Track all activity for a repository

### Project Examples

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Frontend App" icon="browser">
    **Project:** "E-commerce Frontend"
    **Repository:** `myapp-frontend`
    **Typical tasks:**
    - Add product listing page
    - Implement shopping cart UI
    - Create checkout flow
    - Add user profile dashboard
  </Card>
  <Card title="Backend API" icon="server">
    **Project:** "E-commerce API"
    **Repository:** `myapp-backend`
    **Typical tasks:**
    - Create user authentication endpoints
    - Add payment processing service
    - Implement order management
    - Build inventory tracking system
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Creating a Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Dashboard">
    From your Compyle dashboard, click "Create Project"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Project">
    Choose a descriptive name (e.g., "MyApp", "API Backend", "Mobile Client")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Repository">
    Choose which repository this project targets
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Project Rules">
    (Optional) Add custom rules specific to this project
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invite Team">
    (Coming soon) Add team members to collaborate
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Project">
    Click "Create" and your project is ready
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Project Dashboard

Once created, your project dashboard shows:

**Left Side:**
- List of all tasks (with status indicators)
- Recent activity feed
- Quick shortcuts to settings

**Right Side:**
- Create new task button
- Project settings access
- Team members (when available)
- Quick stats (tasks completed, credits used)

## Creating Tasks

Tasks are the core unit of work. You define what needs to be built, and Compyle handles the execution.

### Task Anatomy

Every task needs:

1. **Title** - Clear, descriptive name
2. **Description** - Detailed requirement
3. **Repository** - Which repo (pre-selected from project)
4. **Branch** - Target branch (usually `main`)
5. **Options** - Research phase, etc.

### Task Lifecycle

Tasks go through distinct states:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Created" icon="plus">
    Task defined, not started
  </Card>
  <Card title="Researching" icon="search">
    Agent gathering context
  </Card>
  <Card title="Planning" icon="message-square">
    Agent asking questions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Awaiting Response" icon="clock">
    Waiting for your answers
  </Card>
  <Card title="Implementing" icon="code">
    Agent building code
  </Card>
  <Card title="In Review" icon="eye">
    PR created, awaiting approval
  </Card>
  <Card title="Completed" icon="check">
    Merged to target branch
  </Card>
  <Card title="Failed" icon="x">
    Error occurred
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Task Options

### Skip Research Phase

For small, simple tasks, you can skip research:

- **When**: Task is straightforward, patterns are well-known
- **Benefit**: Faster execution (saves 2-5 minutes)
- **Risk**: Less architectural context, may lead to more planning questions
- **Recommendation**: Keep research enabled for first tasks

### Select Base Branch

Choose which branch to branch OFF of. Compyle will:
1. Create a new feature branch from your selected base branch
2. Make all changes in the new feature branch
3. Create a PR back to the base branch when complete

**Base branch options:**
- **main** - Branch off main (most common)
- **develop** - Branch off develop for release integration
- **feature-xyz** - Branch off another feature branch for dependent work

<Note>
  **Important:** The branch you select is the branch Compyle will **branch from**, not the branch it will commit to directly. Compyle always creates a new feature branch for your task and opens a PR when done.
</Note>

## Task History & Status

View all past tasks and their status:

**Filter by:**
- Date range
- Status (completed, failed, in progress)
- Repository
- Keywords

**View:**
- Task title and description
- Status and completion date
- Links to artifacts (research.md, planning.md)
- Pull request links
- Code changes summary

## Task Description Best Practices

<Tip title="Be Specific">
  Include file names, existing code patterns, specific requirements. Generic descriptions lead to more planning questions.
</Tip>

<Tip title="Provide Context">
  Explain why this task matters. Mention constraints, related features, or architectural concerns.
</Tip>

<Tip title="Include Examples">
  Show examples of what you want. For UI tasks, describe layout. For API tasks, show request/response format.
</Tip>

<Tip title="Mention Edge Cases">
  Tell Compyle about edge cases that need handling. This prevents incomplete implementation.
</Tip>

## Project Settings

Project-level configuration includes:

**Rules**
- Custom rules for this project
- Naming conventions
- Forbidden patterns
- Required patterns

**Repository**
- Which repo to use
- Default branch
- Branch naming patterns

**Team** (Coming Soon)
- Team members
- Role-based access
- Approval workflows

## Organizing Your Tasks

### Small Tasks First

<Tip>
  Start with small, focused tasks (30min-2 hours). This:
  - Lets you understand Compyle's workflow
  - Creates opportunities for quick wins
  - Reduces risk and rework
  - Builds confidence for larger tasks
</Tip>

### Chaining Related Tasks

<Tip>
  When doing related features, create tasks in sequence:

  1. Task 1: Create user model
  2. Task 2: Add API endpoints
  3. Task 3: Build UI components

  Compyle retains context from previous tasks, maintaining consistency.
</Tip>

### Organizing by Feature

Group tasks by feature rather than by type:

**Good**: "Authentication" project with tasks for login, signup, password reset
**Less ideal**: "API" project with mixed unrelated endpoints

# Billing & Plans

<Info title="Compyle is free during beta">
  - **No credit card required** to start
  - **Unlimited tasks** and features included
  - Access limited by credit system (see below)
  - **Duration**: Through [DATE TBD]
</Info>

## How Credits Work

Credits determine how many tasks you can run and are allocated monthly based on your plan. Each task consumes credits based on code complexity.

### Credit Allocation by Plan

| Plan | Monthly Credits | Price | Best For |
|------|-----------------|-------|----------|
| Starter | 100 | Free (beta) | Individuals, learning |
| Pro | 500 | TBD | Active developers |
| Pro+ | 2000 | TBD | Teams, power users |

### Credit Usage Examples

Understanding credit consumption helps you plan your tasks:

- **Simple task** (small file changes, bug fixes): 10-50 credits
- **Medium task** (new feature): 50-150 credits
- **Complex task** (system redesign, large refactor): 150-300+ credits

Credit usage is based on:
- Time spent in research phase
- Number of clarifying questions asked
- Code complexity and implementation time
- Number of validations and checks performed

## Plan Comparison

| Feature | Starter | Pro | Pro+ |
|---------|---------|-----|------|
| Monthly Credits | 100 | 500 | 2000 |
| Task Complexity | Simple | Medium | Any |

# Connect Your GitHub Repository

Compyle needs authorization to read and write to your repositories. This page walks you through the connection process.

## Prerequisites

Before connecting a repository, you'll need:

<Info>
  - A GitHub account
  - Write access to at least one repository
  - To be logged into Compyle
</Info>

## Step-by-Step Connection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Repository Settings">
    From your Compyle dashboard, go to **Settings** → **Connected Repositories** or click "Connect Repository" if this is your first time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Connect GitHub'">
    You'll be redirected to GitHub's OAuth authorization screen. This is GitHub's standard security flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Permissions">
    GitHub will show you what permissions Compyle is requesting. These allow Compyle to:
    - Read your code and repository structure
    - Create branches for implementing tasks
    - Submit pull requests with changes
    - Validate code against your rules
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize Compyle">
    Click "Authorize" to grant Compyle access to your repositories.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Repositories">
    Choose which repositories Compyle can access. You can:
    - Give access to all repositories
    - Select specific repositories only
    - Change this later in Settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Connection">
    After authorization, Compyle will list your connected repositories. Verify the branch structure is correct (usually `main` or `develop` for the default branch).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Permissions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why does Compyle need GitHub access?">
    Compyle needs GitHub access to:
    - **Read** your code to understand patterns and architecture
    - **Create branches** for implementing tasks
    - **Submit PRs** with the generated code changes
    - **Validate changes** against your custom rules before submission
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What can Compyle do with my repos?">
    Compyle can:
    - Read code files and repository structure
    - Create feature branches from your repository
    - Write code files and make changes
    - Create pull requests for review
    - Validate against your custom rules
    - Compyle **cannot**: Force-push, delete branches without permission, or modify protected branches without your approval
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I disconnect a repository later?">
    Yes. Go to **Settings** → **Connected Repositories**, find the repository, and click "Disconnect". Compyle will immediately lose access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Which repositories should I connect?">
    Start with **one repository** to test Compyle's workflow. Once comfortable, add more repositories. We recommend:
    1. Start with a development/staging repo, not production
    2. Test Compyle with a small, well-understood task first
    3. Expand to more repositories as you gain confidence
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<Tip title="Authorization Failed?">
  - Ensure you're logged into GitHub in your browser
  - Check that you have admin rights to the repository
  - Clear your browser cache and try again
  - Contact support if the issue persists
</Tip>

<Tip title="Can't Find Your Repository?">
  - Private repositories may need explicit permission in GitHub settings
  - Ensure you have write access to the repository
  - Check that you authorized Compyle to access the specific repository
  - Contact GitHub support or your repository administrator
</Tip>

<Tip title="Want to Change Connected Repositories?">
  - Go to Settings → Connected Repositories
  - Click "Manage GitHub Access" to change which repos Compyle can see
  - Disconnect any repos you no longer want to use
  - Changes take effect immediately
</Tip>

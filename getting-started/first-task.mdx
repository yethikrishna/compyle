# Create Your First Task

A task is a coding job you want Compyle to help with. Examples include: adding a new feature, fixing a bug, refactoring code, or adding tests. Compyle will research, plan, and implementâ€”with your input every step of the way.

## Step-by-Step Task Creation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Your Dashboard">
    Navigate to your Compyle project. You should see your connected repository and a "Create New Task" button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Your Task Title">
    Give your task a clear, descriptive title. Examples:
    - "Add user authentication with Google OAuth"
    - "Fix bug in password reset flow"
    - "Add unit tests for authentication service"
    - "Refactor API error handling"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write a Detailed Description">
    Provide context about what you want built. The more specific, the better. Include:
    - **What**: What feature or fix you want
    - **Why**: Why it matters
    - **How**: Any specific requirements or constraints
    - **Examples**: File names, existing patterns to follow

    **Good example:**
    ```
    Add user authentication with Google OAuth

    We need to let users log in with Google. When they click
    'Sign in with Google' on the login page, they should
    authorize with Google, then be redirected to the dashboard
    with their info (email, name) stored.

    Use the existing auth pattern from POST /api/auth/login.
    Store user info in the users table, use JWT tokens.
    Add tests for happy path and auth failures.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Repository & Branch">
    Choose which repository and branch your task should target:
    - **Repository**: Select from your connected repos
    - **Branch**: Usually `main`, `develop`, or a feature branch
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Research Phase">
    By default, Compyle includes the research phase. This helps Compyle understand your codebase, patterns, and architecture. For your first task, we recommend keeping this enabled.

    You can skip research for simple, well-defined tasks later.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review & Launch">
    Review all your settings one final time, then click "Launch Agent" to start.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Happens Next?

    ### Agent Timeline

    1. **Research Phase** - Compyle analyzes your codebase
    2. **Planning Phase** - Compyle asks clarifying questions
    3. **Awaiting Response** - Wait for your answers
    4. **Implementation** - Compyle builds the feature
    5. **Pull Request** - Code is ready for review
  </Column>
  <Column>
    ### What You Should Do

    1. **Watch the progress** - Follow along in real-time
    2. **Answer questions** - Reply to planning questions completely
    3. **Review artifacts** - Read research.md and planning.md
    4. **Review code** - Look at generated code before approval
    5. **Test locally** - Verify changes work in your environment
    6. **Approve** - Merge the PR when satisfied

## Best Practices for Your First Task

<Tip title="Start Simple">
  Choose a small, well-defined task for your first try. This helps you understand Compyle's workflow and builds confidence before tackling larger features.
</Tip>

<Tip title="Be Specific">
  The more detail in your task description, the better Compyle understands your intent. Include file names, existing code patterns, and edge cases to handle.
</Tip>

<Tip title="Answer Questions Thoroughly">
  When Compyle asks clarifying questions, answer them completely. These answers become the specification Compyle uses during implementation.
</Tip>

<Tip title="Review Before Approving">
  Read the planning artifact carefully. Review the generated code. Test locally before merging. This ensures the output matches your expectations.
</Tip>

## Example Task

Here's a real example of setting up a task:

**Task Title:** Add user profile page

**Description:**
```
Add a user profile page where authenticated users can view
and edit their profile information.

Create a new route GET /dashboard/profile that shows:
- User's name and email
- Option to update name and email
- Option to change password
- Option to log out

Use the existing AuthContext for authentication check.
Follow the same styling as the dashboard page.
Add tests for authentication checks and form submission.
```

**Repository:** my-app
**Branch:** main
**Research Phase:** Enabled

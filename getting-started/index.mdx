## Why Compyle?

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Other agents make decisions for you" icon="warning">
    They guess what you mean and press forward. By the time you realize it went wrong, you're drowning in slop.
  </Card>
  <Card title="You lose understanding of your code" icon="eye">
    2,000 lines of generated code you don't understand. Now you're stuck patching problems you can't debug.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Building features takes 10x longer" icon="hourglass">
    Autonomous agents mean refactoring. Use Compyle for 0â†’1 that actually scales.

## How Compyle Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Research">
    Compyle gathers context about your codebase, patterns, and existing implementations. It reads your code files, understands your architecture, and studies your conventions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Planning">
    Before writing code, Compyle asks clarifying questions and creates a detailed plan. You answer focused questions. Compyle creates specifications. No surprises.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implementation">
    Compyle validates changes in real-time, stops if something doesn't align, and asks before deciding. Every change verified. Every ambiguity surfaced. You're in control.
  </Step>

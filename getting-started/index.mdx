# The Coding Agent That Asks Before It Builds

Compyle represents a paradigm shift in AI-assisted development. While traditional agents operate autonomously and often generate code that requires extensive rework, Compyle maintains human oversight throughout the entire development process.

## Core Philosophy

**Problem:** Autonomous AI agents make assumptions without confirmation, leading to code that doesn't align with your vision and requires significant refactoring.

**Solution:** Compyle asks clarifying questions before planning, validates every change in real-time, and stops when uncertain—ensuring you maintain control while leveraging AI for implementation.

### The Autonomous Agent Problem

<Columns>
  <Column>
    <h4>What Happens with Autonomous Agents</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Assumption-Based Development:</strong> AI makes decisions without your input</li>
      <li><strong>Massive Code Generation:</strong> Thousands of lines created without your oversight</li>
      <li><strong>Post-Hoc Debugging:</strong> You spend weeks fixing code you didn't write</li>
      <li><strong>Architecture Violations:</strong> New patterns don't match your existing codebase</li>
      <li><strong>Technical Debt:</strong> Refactoring becomes necessary before you can ship</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How Compyle Solves This</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Question-First Approach:</strong> Confirms understanding before implementation</li>
      <li><strong>Incremental Development:</strong> Small, validated changes with your review</li>
      <li><strong>Real-Time Validation:</strong> Issues caught during development, not after</li>
      <li><strong>Pattern Compliance:</strong> Enforces your existing architecture and conventions</li>
      <li><strong>Production-Ready Output:</strong> Code that fits your standards from the start</li>

## How Compyle Works: Three-Phase Development

### Phase 1: Research & Analysis

**Objective:** Understand your codebase, patterns, and existing architecture

**What Compyle Does:**
- Scans your repository for existing patterns and conventions
- Analyzes your file structure and organization
- Studies your coding style and architecture decisions
- Identifies dependencies, frameworks, and technologies
- Reviews existing test patterns and quality standards

**Duration:** 1-5 minutes depending on repository size

**Output:** `research.md` - comprehensive analysis of your codebase

### Phase 2: Planning & Clarification

**Objective:** Create detailed specifications with your input before implementation

**What Compyle Does:**
- Asks specific questions about your requirements
- Proposes implementation approaches based on your codebase
- Clarifies edge cases, error handling, and constraints
- Creates a detailed plan for your review and approval

**Duration:** 5-30 minutes (varies with complexity and your response time)

**Output:** `planning.md` - detailed specification document

### Phase 3: Implementation & Validation

**Objective:** Build code according to specifications with real-time validation

**What Compyle Does:**
- Implements changes incrementally (not in bulk)
- Validates each change against your rules and planning
- Stops and asks when encountering ambiguity or conflicts
- Creates a pull request with organized, readable code

**Duration:** 5 minutes to several hours (depends on feature complexity)

**Output:** Production-ready pull request with validation summary

## Detailed Workflow Comparison

| Step | Autonomous Agents | Compyle |
|------|------------------|---------|
| **Research** | Surface-level file scanning | Deep analysis of patterns, architecture, and conventions |
| **Planning** | None - immediate implementation | Detailed Q&A creating specifications |
| **Development** | Bulk code generation | Incremental, validated changes |
| **Validation** | After completion | Real-time during development |
| **Quality Control** | Manual review afterward | Built-in checks prevent issues |
| **User Involvement** | Minimal oversight | Collaborative decision-making |

## Quick Answers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What makes Compyle different?">
    Unlike autonomous agents that guess and move forward, Compyle asks clarifying questions before planning and implementing. You stay in the driver's seat with full control over architectural decisions, and the agent validates every change in real-time against your requirements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is Compyle free?">
    Yes, Compyle is free during beta. No credit card required. You'll have access to all features with a monthly credit allocation based on your plan.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use it with my existing repos?">
    Absolutely. Compyle works with any GitHub repository you have write access to. Just connect your repo and you're ready to go.

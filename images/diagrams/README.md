# Workflow and Architecture Diagrams

## Purpose
Visual diagrams illustrating Compyle workflows, architecture, and concepts.

## Planned Diagrams
1. **collaborative-approach.svg** - Comparison of autonomous vs collaborative approach
2. Additional workflow visualizations as needed

## Specifications
- **Format**: SVG (preferred) or PNG
- **Dimensions**: Flexible, but optimize for web (max 1200px width)
- **File size**: < 300KB per image
- **Style**: Clean, modern, aligned with Mintlify/Compyle design
- **Colors**: Use Compyle brand palette

## Compyle Brand Colors
- Primary: #0F766E (teal/cyan)
- Light: #F3F4F6 (light gray)
- Dark: #001F1A (very dark teal)

## Current Diagrams
- **Mermaid flowchart** already implemented in `/getting-started/agent-workflow-intro.mdx` (code-based, not in this directory)

## SVG Diagram Guidelines
- Use vector graphics for scalability
- Ensure text is readable at all sizes
- Test in both light and dark modes
- Optimize SVG files (remove unnecessary metadata)
- Use semantic IDs and classes for maintainability

## Potential Future Diagrams
- Integration architecture
- Data flow diagrams
- Security model visualization
- Team collaboration workflows
- API request/response cycles

## Tools for Creating Diagrams
- Figma (export to SVG)
- Excalidraw (simple hand-drawn style)
- draw.io / diagrams.net (technical diagrams)
- Mermaid (code-based, already in use)
- Adobe Illustrator (professional design)

## Usage Locations
- `/features/overview.mdx` - Collaborative approach comparison
- Additional locations as diagrams are created

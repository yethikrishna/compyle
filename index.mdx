## Key Concepts

### The Three Phases

Compyle follows a collaborative workflow:

1. Research - Compyle understands your codebase
2. Planning - Compyle asks clarifying questions
3. Implementation - Compyle builds with real-time validation

### Custom Rules

Define patterns and conventions to guide the agent:

- Naming conventions
- Code structure
- Forbidden patterns
- Required patterns

Learn more: [Custom Rules](/features/custom-rules)

### Real-Time Validation

The agent validates every change against your plan and custom rules. If something doesn't align, it stops and asks.

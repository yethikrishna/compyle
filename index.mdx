### Custom Rules

Define patterns and conventions to guide the agent:

- Naming conventions
- Code structure
- Forbidden patterns
- Required patterns

Learn more: [**Custom Rules**](/features/custom-rules)

### Real-Time Validation

The agent validates every change against your plan and custom rules. If something doesn't align, it stops and asks.

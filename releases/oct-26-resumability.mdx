# Resumability & Smart Branch Naming

**October 26, 2024** • Feature Release

Introducing durable sessions that survive interruptions and intelligent branch naming that makes your git history readable.

---

## Resumability

### Continue Tasks Across Days or Months

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="What Changed" icon="sparkles">
    Tasks are now persistent and recoverable

    - Continue work after days or weeks
    - Automatic recovery when things break
    - Session state persists reliably
    - No need to restart from scratch
  </Card>

  <Card title="Why This Matters" icon="lightbulb">
    Real-world reliability

    - Work interrupted? Pick up where you left off
    - Browser crash? Task continues
    - Network issues? Agent recovers
    - Long-running tasks? No problem
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Durable Session Storage">
    Every task state is continuously saved:
    - Research findings
    - Planning decisions
    - Implementation progress
    - File changes and history
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automatic Recovery">
    If something breaks, Compyle detects and recovers:
    - Restores exact agent state
    - Resumes from last checkpoint
    - No data loss
    - Transparent to you
  </Step>

  <Step title="Long-Term Persistence">
    Tasks remain accessible:
    - Review planning decisions months later
    - Reference research findings
    - Understand implementation rationale
    - Complete audit trail
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Automatic Branch Naming

### Descriptive Branches Generated from Task Details

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="What Changed" icon="sparkles">
    Intelligent branch name generation

    - Based on task title and description
    - Follows git naming conventions
    - Readable and descriptive
    - No more `feature/task-123`
  </Card>

  <Card title="Why This Matters" icon="lightbulb">
    Better git history

    - Know what a branch does at a glance
    - Easier PR reviews
    - Clear git logs
    - Professional branch naming
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Examples

<Accordion title="See Examples">
  **Task:** "Add user profile page"
  **Branch:** `feature/add-user-profile-page`

  **Task:** "Fix memory leak in data processing"
  **Branch:** `fix/memory-leak-data-processing`

  **Task:** "Refactor authentication to use OAuth 2.0"
  **Branch:** `refactor/auth-oauth2`

  **Task:** "Update dependencies and fix breaking changes"
  **Branch:** `chore/update-dependencies-fix-breaking`

  **Naming conventions:**
  - Follows git-flow style prefixes (`feature/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, etc.)
  - Kebab-case for readability
  - Truncated to reasonable length (max 50 chars)
  - Special characters removed
  - Duplicate branch names handled automatically
</Accordion>

## Technical Details

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Resumability Architecture">
    **State Checkpointing:**
    - Continuous state snapshots every 30 seconds
    - Incremental saves for efficiency
    - Compressed storage for performance
    - Distributed backup for reliability

    **Recovery Process:**
    - Automatic detection of interrupted sessions
    - State validation before resumption
    - Conflict resolution for concurrent edits
    - Fallback to last known good state

    **Data Persistence:**
    - Stored encrypted at rest
    - Accessible across devices
    - Retained for 90 days minimum
    - Compliant with data retention policies
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Branch Naming Algorithm">
    **Generation Process:**
    1. Extract key terms from task title
    2. Classify task type (feature/fix/refactor/chore)
    3. Generate kebab-case name
    4. Validate uniqueness in repository
    5. Fallback to numbered suffix if duplicate

    **Customization:**
    - Project-level naming templates (coming soon)
    - Custom prefix patterns (coming soon)
    - Length limits configurable (coming soon)

    **Git Integration:**
    - Creates branch immediately after research
    - Updates remote tracking
    - Handles merge conflicts gracefully
    - Cleans up after PR merge
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## User Impact

<Steps>
  <Step title="No More Lost Work">
    Browser crash? Computer restart? Network outage? Your task continues exactly where it left off.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Work at Your Pace">
    Start a task today, review tomorrow, continue next week. The session waits for you.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Cleaner Git History">
    Branches have meaningful names that explain what they do. No more decoding cryptic branch names.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Better Collaboration">
    Team members can understand branch purposes instantly. PRs are easier to review with descriptive branch names.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Feedback & Known Issues

<Accordion title="Known Limitations">
  **Resumability:**
  - Sessions older than 90 days may be archived
  - Very large tasks (>10GB file changes) may have slower recovery
  - Multi-user conflicts require manual resolution

  **Branch Naming:**
  - Custom templates not yet available
  - Some edge cases may generate generic names
  - Very long task titles are truncated

  **Working on improvements:**
  - Faster recovery for large sessions
  - Smarter conflict resolution
  - Customizable naming templates
</Accordion>

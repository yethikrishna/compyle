# Platform Launch

**November 2024** • Major Release

<Warning>
  **🚀 Compyle is officially live!** Our collaborative AI coding platform is now available to all users.
</Warning>

## Overview

After months of development and beta testing, Compyle is now publicly available. We're introducing a new approach to AI-assisted coding that keeps you in control through collaboration, not blind automation.

## Core Features

### Three-Phase AI Agent Workflow

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Phase 1: Research">
    **Automatic codebase analysis**
    - Pattern recognition across your repositories
    - Architecture comprehension
    - Context gathering from existing code
    - Duration: 1-5 minutes

    The agent explores your codebase to understand:
    - Existing patterns and conventions
    - File structure and organization
    - Technology stack and dependencies
    - Similar implementations to learn from
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Phase 2: Planning">
    **Interactive clarifying questions**
    - Collaborative specification building
    - Decision-making through questions
    - Edge case identification
    - Duration: 5-30 minutes

    Instead of guessing, Compyle asks:
    - Layout preferences (with visual mockups)
    - Technical approach choices
    - Edge case handling
    - Integration details
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Phase 3: Implementation">
    **Real-time code generation with validation**
    - Validation against custom rules
    - Continuous plan alignment checks
    - Automatic PR creation
    - Duration: 5 minutes - 2 hours

    The agent implements while:
    - Following your custom rules
    - Staying aligned with the plan
    - Asking when unclear
    - Creating clean, reviewable PRs
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Custom Rules System

Define your project's patterns and best practices once. Compyle ensures the agent follows them every time.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="JSON-Based Configuration">
    Simple, powerful rule definition:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "React Hook Naming",
      "scope": "src/hooks/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
      "pattern": "^use[A-Z][a-zA-Z]*$",
      "enforcement": "block",
      "message": "Hooks must start with 'use' followed by PascalCase"
    }
    ```

    - Full regex pattern support
    - Glob-based file scoping
    - Custom error messages
    - Easy to version control
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Real-Time Enforcement">
    **During Implementation:**
    - Agent validates code as it writes
    - Catches violations immediately
    - Stops and asks when rules conflict
    - Shows you exactly what violated

    **Three enforcement modes:**
    - **Warn:** Notify but allow exceptions
    - **Block:** Prevent violations entirely
    - **Off:** Temporarily disable
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pattern Library">
    15+ ready-to-use templates:

    **Frontend:**
    - React Hook Naming Convention
    - Component File Organization
    - Consistent Import Order

    **Backend:**
    - RESTful API Endpoint Convention
    - Safe Database Queries
    - Consistent Error Handling

    **General:**
    - TypeScript Strict Mode
    - Test File Naming
    - Conventional Commits
    - Structured Logging
